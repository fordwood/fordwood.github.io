    <b>&nbsp; After 70 years in existence, any manner of things may have taken 
	place with a car. Even if it has been stored
    most of it's entire life, it was made impure at the factory. Parts were made 
	and installed by a
    person. Model T's needed fitting. Factories used over runs from the last year's model, 
	in order to make every
    effort to keep the Model T factory line moving. Ford used <strong>black</strong>
    paint, because it dried faster than any other</b></font><b><font size="2" face="Maiandra GD"> paint.</font></b></font></p>

    <font face="Maiandra GD" size="2"><b>&nbsp; Some autos were knocked down at
    the factory, shipped by train, Re-Assembled at small town dealerships. The dealers
    would hire <strong>anyone</strong> to help put the cars back together. If a part was
    missing or broken, the workers would make a new part. It didn't have to 
	match the other side,
    it just had to fit. Workers even used the crates as floor boards. </b> <strong>Often, when a
    dealer sold a car, it was Titled on the date of sale, not the year it was made.</strong><b>&nbsp;
    Non-USA made Ford Roadsters &amp; Tourings had all working doors.&nbsp; </b> <strong>
    Ford used custom parts as early as 1913. I</strong></font><b><font face="Maiandra GD" size="2">f

    the Brass era.&nbsp; 1917 through 1922, saw these changes: 1917 had a steel radiator
    shell; 1919 demountable rims &amp; electric starter;&nbsp; 1920 cowl lamps became an
    option.&nbsp; 1923 and 1924 cars were identical to each other, but some bodies had steel
    doors; balloon tires; nickel plated radiator shell; the Center Door Sedan was dropped; a
    real Tudor Sedan was made and Henry Ford renamed the Four-door Sedan, to be 
	the Fordor, after himself, which is now a registered trademark for the Ford Motor
    Company. &nbsp; </font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000080"><b><font size="2" face="Maiandra GD">&nbsp; In 1926, the doors and the body
    sills were steel. Everything was about to change. Lower cars; drivers side doors became
